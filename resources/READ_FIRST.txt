The decision to make a line graph would seem to dismiss the point of collecting multiple runs for statistical power.
By plotting a line graph of the averages, a examiner cannot look at other facets of the algorithm, e.g. maximum run times, minimum run times, only the average.
By plotting my graphs as scatter plots, it allows for more information, regarding non-average cases.
It also allows the creation of additional statistics, such as the standard deviation, which would reinforce the validity of an average.
Admittedly, quicksort is very much an average case kind of sort, but without the additional proof from regressions and stastics, that cannot be claimed.

Another note is that unfortunately, my data set of arrays does not reach an a large enough size to give useful data on quicksort runs regarding large data sets.
The array sizes of under 1.28m do not show a very clear polynomial relationship, leading me to have done linear regressions on sets.
