FEEDBACK:

Overall, well done this quarter!


Yes, you are correct in that a scatter plot will provide a more accurate depiction
   of the differences in run time. However, augmenting the scatter plots with a line 
   graph as you have done to more easily read the trends for the smaller array
   sizes, which appear cluttered. 
 
 
+2 Well done in going above and beyond in investigating your results via different
   visual representations and a detailed description of each!
